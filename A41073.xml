         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Womens Speaking Iuſtified, Proved and Allowed by the Scriptures.</head>
            <p>WHereas it hath been an Objection in the minds of many, and ſeveral times hath been objected by the Clergy, or Miniſters, and others, againſt Womens ſpeaking in the Church; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may be taken, that they are condemned for medling in the things of God; the ground of which Objection, is taken from the Apoſtles words, which he writ in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 34, 35. And alſo what he writ to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle; chap. 2. verſ. 11, 12. But how far they wrong the Apoſtles intentions in theſe Scriptures, we ſhall ſhew clearly when we come to them in their courſe and order. But firſt let me lay down how God himſelf hath manifeſted his Will and Mind concerning women, and unto women.</p>
            <p>And firſt, when <hi>God created Man in his owne Image; in the Image of God created he them, Male and Female: and God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply: And God ſaid, Behold, I have given you of every Herb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Here God joyns them together in his own Image, and makes no ſuch diſtinctions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as men do; for though they be weak, he is ſtrong; and as he ſaid to the Apoſtle, <hi>His Grace is ſufficient,</hi> and his <hi>ſtrength is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in weakneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. And ſuch hath the Lord choſen, even <hi>the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, to bring to nought things that are,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. And God hath put no ſuch difference between the Male and Female as men would make.</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>The Serpent that was more ſubtile then any</hi> other <hi>Beaſt of the Field,</hi> came unto the Woman, with his Temptations, and with a lie: his ſubtilty diſcerning her to be more inclinable to hearken to him, when he ſaid, <hi>If ye eat, your eyes ſhall be opened:</hi> and the woman ſaw that <hi>the Fruit was good to make one wiſe,</hi> there the temptation got into her, and <hi>ſhe did eat, and gave to her Husband, and he did eat</hi> alſo, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46365:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo they were both tempted into the tranſgreſſion and diſobedience; and therefore God ſaid unto <hi>Adam,</hi> when that he hid himſelf when he heard his voice, <hi>Haſt thou eaten of the Tree which I commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Woman which thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did eat. And the Lord ſaid unto the Woman, What is this that thou haſt done?</hi> and the Woman ſaid, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi> Here the Woman ſpoke the truth unto the Lord: See what the Lord ſaith, verſ. 15. after he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence on the Serpent; <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel,</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
            <p>Let this Word of the Lord, which was from the beginning, ſtop the mouths of all that oppoſe Womens Speaking in the Power of the Lord; for he hath put enmity between the Woman and the Serpent; and if the Seed of the Woman ſpeak not, the Seed of the Serpent ſpeaks; for God hath put enmity between the two Seeds, and it is manifeſt, that thoſe that ſpeak againſt the Woman and her Seeds Speaking, ſpeak out of the enmity of the old Serpents Seed; and God hath fulfilled his Word and his Promiſe, <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, he hath ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Lord is pleaſed, when he mentions his Church, to call her by the name of <hi>Woman,</hi> by his Prophets, ſaying, <hi>I have called thee as a VVoman forſaken, and grieved in Spirit, and as a wife of Youth,</hi> Iſa. 5.4. Again, <hi>How long wilt thou go about, thou back-ſliding Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman ſhall compaſs a Man,</hi> Jer. 31.22. And <hi>David,</hi> when he was ſpeaking of Chriſt and his Church, he ſaith, <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her cloathing is of wrought Gold; ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King: with gladneſs and rejoycing ſhall they be brought; they ſhall enter into the Kings Pallace.</hi> Pſal. 45. And alſo King <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Song, where he ſpeaks of Chriſt and his Church, where ſhe is complaining and calling for Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>If thou knowest not, O thou faireſt among women, go thy way by the footsteps of the Flock,</hi> Cant. 1.8. c. 5.9. And <hi>John,</hi> when he ſaw the wonder that was in Heaven, he ſaw <hi>a woman cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars; and there appeared another wonder in Heaven, a great red Dragon ſtood ready to devour her Child:</hi> here the enmity appears that God put between the woman and the Dragon, <hi>Revelations</hi> 12.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46365:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Thus much may prove that the Church of Chriſt is a woman, and thoſe that ſpeak againſt the womans ſpeaking, ſpeak againſt the Church of Chriſt, and the Seed of the woman, which Seed is Chriſt; that is to ſay, Thoſe that ſpeak againſt the Power of the Lord, and the Spirit of the Lord ſpeaking in a woman, ſimply, by reaſon of her Sex, or becauſe ſhe is a Woman, not regarding the Seed, and Spirit, and Power that ſpeaks in her; ſuch ſpeak againſt Chriſt, and his Church, and are of the Seed of the Serpent, wherein lodgeth the enmity. And as God the Father made no ſuch difference in the firſt Creation, nor never ſince between the Male and the Female, but alwayes out of his Mercy and loving kindneſs, had regard unto the weak. So alſo, his Son, Chriſt Jeſus, confirms the ſame thing: when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> came to him, and asked him, if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife? he anſwered and ſaid unto them, <hi>Have you not read, That he that made them in the beginning, made them Male and Temale,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife, and they twain ſhall be one fleſh, wherefore they are no more twain but one fleſh; What therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put aſ under,</hi> Mat. 19.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt Jeſus, when he came to the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well was, where the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was; you may read, in <hi>John</hi> 4. how he was pleaſed to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel to her; and when the Woman ſaid unto him, <hi>I know that when the Meſſiah com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> (which is called Chriſt) <hi>when he cometh, he will tell us all things;</hi> Jeſus ſaith unto her, <hi>I that ſpeak unto thee am he;</hi> This is more than ever he ſaid in plain words to Man or Woman (that we read of) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffered. Alſo he ſaid unto <hi>Martha,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, ſhe knew that her Brother ſhould riſe again in the laſt day, Jeſus ſaid unto her, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life: he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſoever liveth and believeth ſhall never die. Believest thou this?</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>Yea Lord, I believe thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> Here ſhe manifeſted her true and ſaving Faith, which few at that day believed ſo on him, <hi>John</hi> 11.25, 26.</p>
            <p>Alſo that Woman that came unto Jeſus with an Alabaſter Box of very precious Oyntment, and poured it on his Head as he ſat at meat; it's manifeſted that this Woman knew more of the ſecret Power and Wiſdom of God, then his Diſciples did, that were filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt her; and therefore Jeſus ſaith, <hi>Why do ye trouble the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? for ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me; Verily, I ſay unto you, Whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole World, there ſhall alſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46365:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>this that this Woman hath done, he told for a memorial of her,</hi> Matt. 26. Mark. 14.3. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith further, <hi>She was a ſinner,</hi> and that <hi>ſhe ſtood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with her tears and did wipe them with the hair of her head, and kiſsed his feet, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed them with Oyntment.</hi> And when Jeſus ſaw the Heart of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> that hath bidden him to his houſe, he took occaſion to ſpeak unto <hi>Simon,</hi> as you may, read in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and he turned to the woman, and ſaid, Simon, <hi>ſeeſt thou this Woman? Thou gaveſt me no water to my feet, but ſhe hath waſhed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head: Thou gavest me no kiſs, but this Woman, ſince I came in, hath not ceaſed to kiſs my Feet: My Head with Oyl thou didſt not annoint, but this Woman hath annointed my Feet with Oyntment; wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſins, which are many, are forgiven her, for ſhe hath loved much,</hi> Luke 7.37, to the end.</p>
            <p>Alſo there was many women wich followed Jeſus from <hi>Galilee,</hi> miniſtring unto him, and ſtood a far off when he was Crucified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.55. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. Yea even the women of Jeruſalem wept for him, inſomuch that he ſaid unto them, <hi>Weep not for me, ye Daughters of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>but weep for your ſelves, and for your Children,</hi> Luke 23.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And certain Women which had been healed of evil Spirits and Infirmities,</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>and</hi> Joanna <hi>the Wife of</hi> Chuza, Herods <hi>Stewards Wife, and many others which miniſtred unto him of their ſubſtance,</hi> Luke 8.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that Jeſus owned the Love and Grace that appeared in Women, and did not deſpiſe it, and by what is recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he received as much love, kindneſs, compaſsion, and tender dealing towards him from Women, as he did from any others, both in his life time, and alſo after they had exerciſed their cruelty upon him, for <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Joſes,</hi> beheld where he was laid: <hi>And when the Sabbath was past,</hi> Mary Migdalen, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi> James, <hi>and</hi> Salom, <hi>had brought ſweet ſpices that they might annoint him: And very early in the morning, the firſt day of the week, they came unto the Sepulchre at the riſing of the Sun, And they ſaid among themſelves who ſhall roll us away the ſtone from the door of the Sepulchre? And when they looked, the ſtone was rolled away for it was very great:</hi> Mark 16.1, 2, 3, 4. Luke 24.1, 2. <hi>and they went down into the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,</hi> and as <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Angel rolled away the ſtone, and he ſaid unto the Women, Fear not, I know whom ye ſeek, Jeſus which was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46365:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Crucified: he is not here, he is riſen,</hi> Mat. 28.

Mark 16.9. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, when <hi>Mary</hi> was weeping at the Sepulchre, that Ieſus ſaid unto her, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou? what ſeekeſt thou?

            <p>Mark this, you that deſpiſe and oppoſe the Meſſage of the Lord God that he ſends by women, what had become of the Redemption of the whole Body of Man-kind, if they had not believed the Meſſage that the Lord Ieſus ſent by theſe women, of and concerning his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?

            <p>Oh! bleſsed and glorified be the Glorious Lord, for this may all the whole body of mankind ſay, though the wiſdom of man, that never

            <p>And in <hi>Act.</hi> 18. you may read how <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> took unto them <hi>Apollos,</hi> and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly; who was an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures: yet we do not read that he deſpiſed what <hi>Priſcilla</hi> ſaid, becauſe ſhe was a Woman, as many now do.</p>
            <p>And now to the Apoſtles words, which is the ground of the great Objection againſt Womens ſpeaking: And firſt, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. let the Reader ſeriouſly read that Chapter, and ſee the end and drift of the Apoſtle in ſpeaking theſe words: for the Apoſtle is their exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto charity, and to defire Spiritual gifts, and not to ſpeak in an unknown tongue, and not to be Children in underſtanding, but to be Children in malice, but in underſtanding to be men; and that the Spirits of the Prophets ſhould be ſubject to the Prophets, for God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace: And then he ſaith, <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where it doth plainly appear that the women, as well as others, that were among them, were in confuſion, for he ſaith, <hi>How is it Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Interpretation? let all things be done to edifying.</hi> Here was no edifying, but all was in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpeaking together: Therefore he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſpeak in an unknown Tongue, let it be by two, or at moſt by three, and that by courſe, and let one Interpret, but if there be no Interpreter, let him keep filence in the Church.</hi> Here the Man is commanded to keep ſilence as well as the woman, when they are in confuſion and out of order.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle ſaith further, <hi>They are commanded to be in Obedience,</hi> as alſo ſaith the Law; and <hi>if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle clearly manifeſts his intent; for he ſpeaks of women that were under the Law, and in that Tranſgreſſion as <hi>Eve</hi> was, and ſuch as were to learn, and not to ſpeak publickly, but they muſt firſt ask their Husbands at home, and it was a ſhanie for ſuch to ſpeak in the Church: And it appears clearly, that ſuch women were ſpeaking among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by the Apoſtles exhorting them from malice and ſtrife, and confuſion, and he preacheth the Law unto them, and he ſaith, in the Law it is written, <hi>With men of other tongues, and other lips, will I ſpeak unto this people,</hi> verſ. 2.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46365:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And what is all this to Womens Speaking? that have the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel to preach, and upon whom the Promiſe of the Lord is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and his Spirit poured upon them according to his word, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. And if the Apoſtle would have ſtopped ſuch as had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord poured upon them, why did he ſay juſt before, <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace?</hi> and <hi>you may all propheſie one by one.</hi> Here he did not ſay that ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not Propheſie as had the Revelation and Spirit of God poured upon them, but their Women that were under the Law, and in the Tranſgreſſion, and were in ſtrife, confuſion and malice in their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for if he had ſtopt Womens praying or propheſying, why doth he ſay: <hi>Every man praying or propheſying having his head covered, dishonoureth his head; but every Woman that prayeth or propheſieth with her head unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, diſhonoureth her head? Judge in your ſelves, Is it comely that a Woman pray or propheſie uncovered? For the Woman is not without the Man, neither is the Man without the Woman, in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3, 4, 13.</p>
            <p>Alſo that other Scripture, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. where he is exhorting that Prayer and Supplication be made every where, lifting up holy Hands without wrath and doubting; he ſaith in the like manner alſo, That <hi>Women muſt adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearl, or coſtly array;</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Let Women learn in ſilence with all ſubjection, but I ſuffer not a Woman to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence; for</hi> Adam <hi>was firſt formed, then</hi> Eve; <hi>and</hi> Adam <hi>was not deceived, but the Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks particularly to a Woman in Relation to her husband, to be in ſubjection to him, and not to teach, nor uſurp au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, and therefore he mentions <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> But let it be ſtrained to the utmoſt, as the oppoſers of Womens Speaking would have it, that is, That they ſhould not preach nor ſpeak in the Church, of which there is nothing here: Yet the Apoſtle is ſpeaking to ſuch as he is teaching to wear their apparel, what to wear, and what not to wear; ſuch as were not come to wear modeſt apparel, and ſuch as were not come to ſhamefaſtneſs and ſobriety, but he was exhorting them from broidered hair, gold, and pearls, and coſtly array; and ſuch are not to uſurp authority over the Man, but to learn in ſilence with all ſubjection, as it becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs with good works.</p>
            <p>And what is all this to ſuch as have the Power, and Spirit of the Lord
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46365:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Jeſus poured upon them, and have the Meſſage of the Lord Jeſus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them? muſt not they ſpeak the Word of the Lord becauſe of theſe undecent and unreverent Women that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, and to, in theſe two Scriptures?

If the Apoſtle would have had Womens ſpeaking ſtopt, and did not allow of them, why did he entreat his true Yoak-fellow to help thoſe Women who laboured with him in the Goſpel? <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. And why did the Apoſtles joyn together in Prayer and Suppication with the Women, and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jeſus, and with his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But all this oppoſing and gain-ſaying of Womens Speaking; hath riſen out of the bottomleſs Pit, and ſpirit of Darkneſs that hath ſpoken for theſe many hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this night of Apoſtacy, ſince the Revelations have ceaſed and been bid, and ſo that ſpirit hath limited and bound all up within its bond and compaſs, and ſo would ſuffer none to ſpeak, but ſuch as that ſpirit of Darkneſs, approved of, Man or Woman.</p>
            <p>And ſo here hath been the miſery of theſe laſt Ages paſt, in the time of the Reign of the Beaſt, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw when he ſtood upon the Sand of the Sea, riſing out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. In this great City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is the woman that hath ſitten ſo long upon the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns; and this Woman hath been arrayed and decked with gold, and pearls, and precious ſtones; and ſhe hath had a golden Cup in her hand, full of Abominations, and hath made an Nations drunk with the Cup of her Fornication; and all the world hath wondred after the Beaſt, and hath worſhipped the Dragon that gave power to the Beaſt; and this woman hath been drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus; and this hath been the woman that hath been ſpeaking and uſurping authority, for many hundred years together: And let the times and ages paſt teſtifie how many have been murdered and ſlain, in Ages and Generations paſt; every Religion and Profeſſion (as it hath been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alled) killing and murdering one another, that would not joyn one with another. And thus the Spirit of Truth, and the Power
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46365:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath been quite loſt among them that have done this; and this mother of Harlots hath ſitten as a Queen, and ſaid, <hi>She should ſee no ſorrow,</hi> but though her dayes have been long, even many hundred of years, for there was power given unto the Beaſt, to continue forty and two months, and to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them; and all that have dwelt upon the earth have worſhipped him, whoſe names are not written in the Book of the Life of the Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the Lord, his time is over, which was above twelve hundred Years, and the darkneſs is paſt, and the night of Apoſtacy draws to an end, and the true light now ſhines, the morning-Light the bringt morning Star, the Root and Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> he is riſen, he is riſen, glory to the higheſt for evermore; and the joy of the morning is come, and the Bride the Lambs Wife, is making her ſelf ready, as a Bride that is adorning for her Husband, and to her is granted that ſhe ſhall be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white, and the fine linnen is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints: The <hi>Holy Jeruſalem</hi> is deſcending out of Heaven from God, having the Glory of God, and her light is like a Jaſper ſtone, clear as Chriſtal.</p>
            <p>And this is that free Woman that all the Children of the Promiſe are born of; not the Children of the bond-woman, which is <hi>Hagar,</hi> which genders to ſtrife and to bondage, and which anſwers to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is in bondage with her Children; but this is <hi>the Jeruſalem which is free, whch is the Mother of us all;</hi> And ſo this bond-woman and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that are born after the fleſh, have perſecuted them that are born after the Spirit, even untill now; but now the bond-woman and her Seed is to be caſt out, that hath kept ſo long in bondage and in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and under limits; this bond-woman and her brood is to be caſt out, and our Holy City, the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> is coming down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and her Light will ſhine throughout the whole earth, even as a <hi>Jaſper stone, clear as Chriſtal,</hi> which brings freedom and liberty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redemption to her whole Seed; and this is that woman and Image of the Eternal God, that God hath owned, and doth own, and will own for evermore.</p>
            <p>More might be added to this purpoſe, both out of the Old Teſtament and New, where it is evident that God made no difference, but gave his good Spirit, as it pleaſed him both to Man and Woman, as <hi>Deborah, Huldah,</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> The Lord calls by his <hi>prophet Iſaiah, Hearken unto me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A further Addition in Anſwer to the Objection concerning Women keeping ſilent in the Church;</head>
            <argument>
               <p>For it is not permitted for them to ſpeak, but to be under obedience; as alſo ſaith the Law, If they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church: <hi>Now this as</hi> Paul <hi>writeth in</hi> 1 Cor. 14.34. <hi>is one with that of</hi> 1 Tim. 2.11. <hi>Let Women learn in ſilence, with all ſubjection.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO which I ſay, If you tie this to all outward Women, then there where many Women that were Widows which had no Husbands to learn of, and many were Virgins which had no Husbands; and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had four Daughters that were Prophets; ſuch would be deſpiſed, which the Apoſtle did not forbid: And if it were to all Women, that no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might ſpeak, then <hi>Paul</hi> would have contradicted himſelf; but they were ſuch Women that the Apoſtle mentions in <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>grew wanton, and were buſie-bodies, and tatlers, and kicked againſt Chriſt:</hi> For Chriſt in the Male and in the Female is one, and he is the Husband, and his Wife is the Church, and God hath ſaid, that his <hi>Daughters</hi> ſhould Propheſie as well as his <hi>Sons:</hi> And where he hath poured forth his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon them, they muſt propheſie, though blind Prieſts ſay to the contrary, and will not permit holy Women to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>I permit not a Woman to ſpeak, as ſaith the Law:</hi> but where Women are led by the Spirit of God, they are not under the Law, for Chriſt in the Male and in the Female is one; and where he is made manifeſt in Male and Female, he may ſpeak, for <hi>he is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all them that believe.</hi> So here you ought to make a diſtinction what ſort of Women are forbidden to ſpeak, ſuch as were under the Law, who were not come to Chriſt, nor to the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: For <hi>Hulda, Miriam,</hi> and <hi>Hanna,</hi> were Prophets, who were not forbidden in the time of the Law, for they all propheſied in the time of the Law: as you may read, in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. what <hi>Hulda</hi> ſaid unto the Prieſt, and to the Ambaſſadors that were ſent to her from the King, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>and tell the Man that ſent you to me, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and on the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even all the words of the Book which the King of</hi> Judah <hi>hath read, becauſe they have forſaken me, and have burnt Incence to other Gods, to anger me with all the works of their hands: Therefore my wrath ſhall be kindled againſt this place, and ſhall not be quenched. But to the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46365:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſent you to me to ask counſel of the Lord, ſo ſhall you ſay to him, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, Becauſe thy heart did melt, and thou humbleſt thy ſelf before the Lord, when thou heardest what I ſpake againſt this place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Inhabitants of the ſame, how they ſhould be deſtroyed; Behold I will receive thee to thy Father, and thou ſhalt be put into thy Grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil which I will bring upon this place.</hi> Now let us ſee if any of you blind Prieſts can ſpeak after this manner, and ſee if it be not a better Sermon then any of you can make, who are againſt Womens ſpeaking? And <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that went to the Propheteſs, did not forbid her Speaking or Propheſying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. And was it not propheſied in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. that <hi>Hand maids ſhould Propeſie?</hi> And are not Hand-maids Women? Conſider this, ye that are againſt Womens Speaking, how in the <hi>Acts</hi> the Spirit of the Lord was poured forth upon Daughters as well as Sons. In the time of the Goſpel, when <hi>Mary</hi> came to ſalute <hi>Elizabeth in the Hill Country in</hi> Judea, <hi>and when</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>heard the ſalutation of</hi> Mary, <hi>the Babe leaped in her Womb, and ſhe was filled with the Holy Spirit; and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>ſpoke with a loud voice, Bleſsed art thou amongst Women, bleſsed is the fruit of thy Womb; whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come to me? for lo, as ſoon as thy Salutation came to my ear, the Babe leaped in my Womb for joy, for bleſſed is ſhe that believes, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</hi> And this was <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Sermon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, which at this day ſtands upon Record<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And alſo ſee in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Samuel,</hi> how <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed and ſpake in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, <hi>Oh Lord of Hoſts, if thou wilt look on the trouble of thy Hand maid, and remember me, and not forget thy Hand-maid.</hi> And read in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Samuel,</hi> How ſhe rejoyced in God, and ſaid, <hi>My heart rejoyceth in the Lord; My Horn is exalted in the Lord and my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, becauſe I rejoyce in thy Salvation; there is none holy as the Lord, yea, there is none beſides thee; and there is no God like our God: Speak no more preſumptouſly, let not arrogancy come out of your mouths, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him enterpriſes are establiſhed; the Bow, and the mighty Men are broken, and the weak hath girded to themſelves ſtrength; they that were full, are hired forth for bread, and the hungry are no more hired, ſo that the barren hath born ſeven, and ſhe that had many Children, is feeble; the Lord killeth, and maketh alive; bringeth down to the Grave, and raiſeth up; the Lord maketh poor, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich, bringeth low and exalteth, he raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the Beggar from the dunghil to ſet them among Princes, to make them inherit the ſeat of Glory for the Pillars of the earth are the Lords, &amp; he hath ſet the world upon them; he will keep the feet of his Saints, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall keep ſilence in darkneſs, for in his own might ſhall no man be ſtrong; the Lords Adverſaries ſhall be deſtroyed, and out of Heaven ſhall he thunder upon them; the Lord ſhall judge the ends of the World, and ſhall give power to his King; and exalt the Horn of his Anointed.</hi> Thus you may ſee what a woman hath ſaid, when old <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt thought ſhe had been drunk, and ſee if any of you blind Prieſts that ſpeak againſt Womens Speaking, can Preach after this manner? who cannot make ſuch a Sermon as this woman did, and yet will make a trade of this Woman and other womens words. And did not the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſpeak, that came to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and received the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and <hi>preached</hi> it in her own Kingdom, and <hi>bleſsed the Lord God that loved</hi> Solomon, <hi>and ſet him on the throne of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>becauſe the Lord loved</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever; and made the King to do Equity and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> And this was the lang age of the Queen of <hi>Shebae.</hi> And ſee what glorious expreſſions Queen <hi>Hester</hi> uſed to comfort the People of God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46365:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>which was the Church of God, as you may read in the book of <hi>Hester,</hi> which cauſed joy and gladneſs of heart among all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who prayed and worſhipped the Lord in all places, who jeoparded her life contrary to the Kings command, went and ſpoke to the King, in the wiſdom and fear of the Lord, by which means ſhe ſaved the lives of the People of God; and righteous <hi>Mordecai</hi> did not forbid her ſpeaking, but ſaid, <hi>If ſhe held her peace, her and her Fathers houſe ſhould be deſtroyed;</hi> and herein you blind Prieſts are contrary to Righteous <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe you may read how <hi>Judith</hi> ſpoke, and what noble acts ſhe did, and how ſhe ſpoke to the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Dear Brethren, ſeeing ye are the honorable &amp; elders of the People of God, call to remembrance how our Fathers in time past were tempted, that they might be proved if they would worship God aright; they ought alſo to remember how our Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>being tryed through manifold tribulations, was found a friend of God; ſo was</hi> Iſaac, Jacob, <hi>and</hi> Moſes, <hi>and all they pleaſed God, and were ſtedfaſt in Faith through manifold troubles.</hi> And read alſo her prayer in the Book of <hi>Judith,</hi> and how the Elders commended her, and ſaid, <hi>All that thou ſpeakest is true, and no man can reprove thy words, pray therefore for us, for thou art an holy Woman, and feareſt God.</hi> So theſe elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not forbid her ſpeaking, as you blind Prieſts do; yet you will make a Trade of Womens words to get money by, and take Texts, and Preach Sermons upon Womens words; and ſtill cry out, Women muſt not ſpeak, Women muſt be ſilent; ſo you are far from the minds of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who praiſed God for a Womans ſpeaking. But the <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and the Woman, the falſe Church, the great Whore, and tatling women, and buſie-bodies, which are forbidden to Preach, which have a long time ſpoke and tatled, which are forbidden to ſpeak by the True Church, which Chriſt is the Head of; ſuch Women as were in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion under the Law, which are called a Woman in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And ſee further how the wiſe VVoman cryed to <hi>Joab</hi> over the VVall, and ſaved the City of <hi>Abel,</hi> as you may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. how in her, wiſdom ſhe ſpoke to <hi>Joab,</hi> ſaying, I <hi>am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and thou goeſt about to deſtroy a city and Mother in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>Why wilt thou deſtroy the Inheritance of the Lord? Then went the woman to the people in her wiſdom, and ſmote off the head of</hi> Sheba, <hi>that roſe up againſt</hi> David, <hi>the Lords Anointed: Then</hi> Joab <hi>bled the Trumpet, and all the People departed in peace.</hi> And this deliverance was by the means of a Womans ſpeaking; but tatlers, and buſie bodies, are forbidden to preach by the True Woman, whom Chriſt is the Husband,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46365:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Woman as well as the Man, all being comprehended to be the Church; and ſo in this True Church, Sons and Daughters do Propheſie, Women labour in the Goſpel; but the Apoſtle permits not tatlers, buſie-bodies, and ſuch as uſurp authority over the Man would not have Chriſt Reign, nor ſpeak neither in the Male nor Female; Such the Law permits not to ſpeak, ſuch muſt learn of their Husbands: But what Husbands have Widows to learn of, but Chriſt? And was not Chriſt the Husband of <hi>Philips</hi> four Daughters? And may not they that learn of their Husbands ſpeak then? But <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and Tatlers, and the Whore that denies Revelation and Propheſie, are not permitted, which will not learn of Chriſt; and they that be out of the Spirit and Power of Chriſt, that the Prophets were in, who are in the Tranſgreſsion, are ignorant of the Scriptures; and ſuch are againſt Womens ſpeaking, and Mens too, who Preach that which they have received of the Lord God; but that which they have preached, and do preach, will come over all your heads, yea, over the head of the falſe Church, the Pope; for the Pope is the Head of the Falſe Church, and the Falſe Church is the Popes Wife: and ſo he and they that be of him, and come from him, are againſt Womens ſpeaking in the True Church, when both he and the falſe Church are called <hi>Woman,</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. and ſo are in the Tranſgreſsion that would uſurp authority over the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Wife too, and would not have him to Reign; but the Judgment of the great Whore is come. But Chriſt, who is the Head of the Church, the True Woman which is his Wife, in it do Daughters Propheſie, who are above the Pope and his Wife and a top of them; And here Chriſt is the Head of the Male and Female, who may ſpeak; and the Church is called <hi>a Royal Priesthood;</hi> ſo the Woman muſt offer as well as the Man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit ſaith, Come, and the Bride ſaith, Come:</hi> and ſo is not the Bride the Church? and doth the Church only conſiſt of Men? you that deny Womens ſpeaking, anſwer: Doth it not conſiſt of Women as well as men? Is not the Bride compared to the whole Church? And doth not the Bride ſay, <hi>Come?</hi> Doth not the Woman ſpeak then? the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Amen,</hi> and doth not the falſe Church go about to ſtop the Brides Mouth? But it is not poſſible for the Bridegroom is with his Bride, and he opens her Mouth. Chriſt Jeſus, who goes on Conquering, and to Conquer, who kill and ſlayes with the Sword, which is the words of his Mouth; the Lamb and the Saints ſhall have the Victory, the true Speakers of Men and Women over the falſe Speaker.</p>
